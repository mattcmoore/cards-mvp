- The getEditCard method (get-one request from editCardId in state) works initially, but brakes when I change form inputs that use state that 
it sets as props? It looks like the new component is rendering before the state that i'm using to build the new component gets set. 
I know I could do useEffect in the component I want to show the state in but...

Should I just do the get-one request locally so I can put it in a local use state, vs. do all my fetches in the App component like you told us?

- Is it good practice to split up functions in a handler the way that I do it, or to run them in the asynchronous fetch function. All I do in
the fetch is get the data and pass it to a setState. Shoulid I have it hide and how right after I do the setState?
